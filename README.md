# FormsWebSocket
##1. Overview
WebSocket provides an alternative to the limitation of efficient communication 
between the server and the web browser by providing:
- bi-directional 
- full-duplex 
- real-time 
client/server communications. 
The server can send data to the client at any time. 
Because it runs over TCP, it also provides a low-latency low-level communication and 
reduces the overhead of each message.
